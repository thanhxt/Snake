# Snake
In this project im trying to build the snake game in Java.

The Goal of the game is to eat as much points. While you eat a point by passing by one your Snake is getting bigger by one UNIT_SIZE. The game ends if you collude with yourself or with the boarder. 

The Snake is moving in a Matrix which we set it before the game starts. In that matrix our Points will appear randomly in our matrix with the java.Random class.
